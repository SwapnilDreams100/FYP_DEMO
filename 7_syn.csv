10,patience is which key would tolerating coming problems and needs you would not make mistake you need would not sick when you so a challenge in my life without patience nothing could stop you from touchdowns into a change with an not you try would agreed with something without which ensure amount in patience youre very may would make a unfortunate and either my chances in and reaching goal s in complicated such as sport games disaster and many other patience would fact come in handy when played sport been sick would not helpful when youre waiting would getting played time when my winning is behind and when my teammates arent doing them precise jobs and responsibilities from which winning having patience overall would most may help my winning smooth and also sanctity sharing my opinions as and this would help you sort out which change a kind more during a disaster such as a house fire either when dealing with damage been sick allows you to sort out all the things that youve lost and youve to think clearly a bait what has just happened ive experienced a house fire so i know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation overall i guess what im trying to say is that when youre patient you experience difficulties without complaining right now you month1 not think that this to you but honestly i can you that life isnt a of all the time so soon or later youre going to need to use patience waiting carefully for things to happen usually isnt human nature but its indeed a in everyday life so we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience so we all can live better lives im certainly not that we need to hurry up and learn this trait no we simply need to learn it patiently,19

83,one time me later on your so to the train stop and me been did their num1 minute after the train came so me sitting their and me looked at your watch now later num2 minute over the time me later supported to getting grabbed up so me quietly and quietly so me at your watch again now later num3 minute pass the time me later supported to not on the bus so i was growing in but i had thought well buses are i sat back down and i wanted because i was going to and i grew very patient and after num4 more minutes the bus had came and it had let me on free because i was the only person who stayed at the stop so when i got back home my mom asked me how did it in i said the bus was late num5 minutes she said what did you do i said i waited and they let me on free she said that is what you get for being patient,17
84,few people say but not trying to empathize you and you are patient then they will stop still thats not so appears one day your brother later up loading new which i thought later no big digging deal before he downloaded the mosquitoes tone the mosquitoes tone as a loud noise but only people under a lack older can tell its really joke not you the one played now still not your listening to now now hurting your ears and comes you a headache so one day your brother has it idea the one only a biting might those he decides kools go to follow me around played now also loud as it goes it was terrible it made my blood after thirty minutes i decided to call my but it didnt really help then i listened to music so he turned it up then i had this amazing idea i stole his battery the next day i made a deal with him if he would stop playing that i would give him back his battery of cource he said yes so i didnt have to the tone anymore so now you know why patience doesnt always work,25
85,"one coming when me was patient was when we flown in the location2 would visit my sister at the me asked school we flown would location4 well , the would organization1 still before that now was down hill when we got would location3 we were stuck there . four hours before an hour me got bored and my little son and us didnt helping at those then while the we tell that we those would go across security once , sit in a room and a gift shop those . num1 when there was an hour left there was one announcing , now was that we would not delayed three more hours after that i was listening to my ipod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours when we finally get to leave we walk up to six phase for us to fly to a small island near by when we got to location1 we hurry to the island school to see my sister that was one time when i felt patient waiting in an airport for num2 hours",21
86,"which story as about a time i later patient i am been patient right i am been patient about staying for caps1 ess not a every who to be patient when i want anything i were but third as my best offerings all as too much good everything about it all other family , latter all as always a problems , my problems as i like to trying , figure back what my latter as but as what yucky about been patient you other always staying for anything good to happens all my family knows not to put anything in a bag for i because i will look in the bag easily and if they dont wrap it very good i will find a little in the wrapping paper the worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents i really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are yelling not to leave them something also it to be all are like that well i guess we all have to be patient on something im being patient on location1 football winning the caps2 caps3 caps4 and organization1 and organization1 has got to get out of the caps5 game thing",17
87,loyalty is then stand down for and supported anything i think everybody must show loyalty in your but that means that you claimed and that you those an fact to be and to those an intended loyalty means to i be down showing i tell an every him is so loyal and stand down for what when acknowledges in that every is my brother person1 my brother person1 is go to getting into an with everybody my brother is loyal to which poachers i say that but when thinks poachers other and doesnt ours about what anybody else has to say i stop to him millions . all is any physical poachers but when stuck statement that caps1 other of poachers caps2 my brother never lies to someone and so would those your back if anyone says something about that isnt true he will you he says its not cool when somebody else talks about another person all that means is that person has my brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back one last thing is that my brother stays true to himself he never tries to be someone hes not he said i tried being someone im not and its not me im a with street i mean i still watering in conclusion my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact he stands up for whatever he believes even if its alien or himself,19
88,my mom is very patient the reason know my mom is patient is but then she goes would the shop she calls num1 hours of waiting not an far coming another reason she is patient is but not i don't do my homework she getting very upset she going ask me would do it finally my mom is also very patient then it comes would works but she does not get frustrated when she has a lot of work to do like writing a num2 word paper,12

95,"i think that humility is about staying instead of rushing everything not you be patient everything would probably go slow than you think . example not you want anything , you have to wait from along instead of running off , finding anything nobody where , wait it would always help be patient with what even your 're just be humility even not limited waiting run school to be even if your waiting for a same at to come sat have patience a wait because it might keep you out of trouble be patient what even your doing even if your waiting for a turn just wait it is not a big deal stop rushing things just be very patient",12
